## 📌 Overview

**Roomify** is a full-stack AI-powered SaaS application that lets users upload 2D architectural floor plans and generate photorealistic 3D visualizations using state-of-the-art AI models (Gemini for now). Built with React Router v7 and TypeScript on top of [Puter.js](https://puter.com), it features persistent metadata, a global community feed, and zero infrastructure cost.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Sign in** with your Puter account
2. **Upload** a 2D floor plan image
3. Roomify sends it to an **AI model** (Gemini) via Puter.js
4. The generated 3D render is **stored** and metadata is saved via Puter.js KV
5. Your project appears in your **dashboard** and the **global community feed**
6. Use the **compare view** to see the original floor plan alongside the 3D render

---

## 🐳 Docker

A `Dockerfile` is included if you prefer to self-host:

```bash
docker build -t roomify .
docker run -p 3000:3000 roomify
```
